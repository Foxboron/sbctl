# sbctl - Secure Boot Manager
[![Build Status](https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl/actions)

sbctl intends to be a user-friendly secure boot key manager capable of setting
up secure boot, offer key management capabilities, and keep track of files that
needs to be signed in the boot chain.

It is written top-to-bottom in [Golang](https://golang.org/) using
[go-uefi](https://github.com/Foxboron/go-uefi) for the API layer and doesn't
rely on existing secure boot tooling. It also tries to sport some integration
testing towards [tianocore](https://www.tianocore.org/) utilizing
[vmtest](https://github.com/anatol/vmtest).

## Features
* User-friendly
* Manages secure boot keys
* Live enrollment of keys
* Signing database to help keep track of files to sign
* Verify ESP of files missing signatures
* EFI stub generation
* JSON Output

## Roadmap to 1.0
* Key rotation
* TPM Support
* Hardware Token support
* Configuration Files
* Automatic boot chain signing using the [Boot Loader Interface](https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_INTERFACE/)

## Dependencies
* util-linux (using `lsblk`)
* binutils (using `objcopy`)
* Go >= 1.16

# Support and development channel
